# KLEP_Embedded 🚀

⚠️ **Coming Soon!** ⚠️  

KLEP_Embedded is an adaptation of the **KLEP (Key-Lock Execution Process) system** for **embedded systems and microcontrollers**. This repository will bring **KLEP’s goal-driven AI and decision-making model** to **low-level hardware** like ATmega, ARM, and other MCUs.  

Stay tuned as we roll out:  
✅ **Key-based symbolic execution for microcontrollers**  
✅ **Lightweight AI processing on constrained hardware**  
✅ **Integration with real-time control systems**  

### **Want a Higher-Level Approach?**
